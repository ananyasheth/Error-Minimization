# Error Minimization 
Model Accuracy is a very important aspect when it comes to implemeting the right algorithms.
I tried applying a bunch of Classification algorithms like KNN, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. The purpose of this exercise was to obtain the accuracy of the given dataset through Jaccard index, F1-score and Logarithmic loss to check which model resulted in minimum margin of error and obtain the best fit for the given dataset.
Just tried my hands on Prediction Analysis
